"""All-in pricing — fold the XVA charge into the structurer's solve (ADR-0007, Phase 4).

The structuring desk solves the coupon so the note's PV equals ``par − fee`` (the issuer keeps the
fee as margin). But the issuer *also* bears the note's lifetime counterparty and funding cost — its
**XVA**. Carrying that in, fairness becomes ``PV = par − fee − XVA``: the target PV drops by the
charge, so the coupon the desk can offer drops with it — and drops *further* as the counterparty's
credit spread widens. That is the headline of combining the two desks: a price that is honest about
what the note actually costs to carry.

CVA comes straight from the XVA engine (EE × default-probability × discount). FVA is the funding
cost of the expected positive exposure at the issuer's funding spread (a standard FCA integral).
Optionally the charge also carries **DVA** (the mirror benefit from the issuer's own default),
**KVA** (the cost of holding regulatory capital over the trade's life), **MVA** (the funding cost of
initial margin), and a **wrong-way-risk** tilt on the CVA exposure — so the all-in number can be
unilateral CVA+FVA (the default) or a fuller ``CVA + FVA + KVA + MVA − DVA``.
